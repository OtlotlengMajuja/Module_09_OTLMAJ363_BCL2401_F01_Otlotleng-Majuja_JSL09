# JSL09: Promise Rejection Dashboard
# Introduction
The task was to use the Scrimba Promise Rejection capstone to build a Personal Dashboard for my Chrome Browser.

# Elements Included
Fetching data from APIs, promise handling, DOM manipulation, the interval function, and geolocation.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**API Integration:** With the help of the capstone, I was able to integrate several third-party APIs into the application to retrieve a variety of data kinds (weather, cryptocurrency, and image data).
**Geolocation Integration:** I was also able to add customised features to the application by utilising geolocation to deliver location-based weather data.

# Challenges Faced
I was a little hesitant I would be able to about control the flow of asynchronous processes (such as updating the DOM and retrieving data) to prevent race conditions, and guarantee efficient execution.

# Overall Learning Experience
What I learned was how to handle asynchronous activities, update the DOM dynamically, integrate various APIs, and manage failures. Incorporating geolocation also gave the program a personalized and interactive element that improved its usability and user experience. All things considered, this code demonstrated a comprehensive grasp of contemporary web development methods and API utilization.
